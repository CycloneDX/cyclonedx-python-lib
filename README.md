----

This CycloneDX module for Python can generate valid CycloneDX bill-of-material document containing an aggregate of all
project dependencies. CycloneDX is a lightweight BOM specification that is easily created, human-readable, and simple 
to parse.

**This module is not designed for standalone use.**

As of version `3.0.0`, the internal data model was adjusted to allow CycloneDX VEX documents to be produced as per
[official examples](https://cyclonedx.org/capabilities/bomlink/#linking-external-vex-to-bom-inventory) linking a VEX 
documents to a separate BOM document.

If you're looking for a CycloneDX tool to run to generate (SBOM) software bill-of-materials documents, why not checkout 
[CycloneDX Python][cyclonedx-python] or [Jake][jake].

Alternatively, you can use this module yourself in your application to programmatically generate CycloneDX BOMs.

## Python Support

We endeavour to support all functionality for all [current actively supported Python versions](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
However, some features may not be possible/present in older Python versions due to their lack of support.
