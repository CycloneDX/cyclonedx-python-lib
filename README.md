# Python Library for generating CycloneDX

_Coming soon!_

## The Fine Print

Remember:

It is worth noting that this is **NOT SUPPORTED** by Sonatype, and is a contribution of ours
to the open source community (read: you!)

* Use this contribution at the risk tolerance that you have
* Do NOT file Sonatype support tickets related to `cyclonedx-python-lib` support in regard to this project
* DO file issues here on GitHub, so that the community can pitch in

Phew, that was easier than I thought. Last but not least of all - have fun!
