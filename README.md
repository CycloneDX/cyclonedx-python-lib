----

This CycloneDX module for Python can generate valid CycloneDX bill-of-material document containing an aggregate of all
project dependencies.

This module is not designed for standalone use.  
If you're looking for a CycloneDX tool to run to generate (SBOM) software bill-of-materials documents, why not checkout:
[CycloneDX Python][cyclonedx-python]

Additionally, the following tool can be used as well (and this library was written to help improve it)
[Jake][jake]

Additionally, you can use this module yourself in your application to programmatically generate SBOMs.

CycloneDX is a lightweight BOM specification that is easily created, human-readable, and simple to parse.

## Installation

Install from pypi.org as you would any other Python module:

```
pip install cyclonedx-python-lib
```

## Architecture

This module break out into three key areas:

1. **Parser**: Use a parser that suits your needs to automatically gather information about your environment or
   application
2. **Model**: Internal models used to unify data from different parsers
3. **Output**: Choose and configure an output which allows you to define output format as well as the CycloneDX schema
   version

### Parsing

You can use one of the parsers to obtain information about your project or environment. Available parsers:

| Parser | Class / Import | Description |
| ------- | ------ | ------ |
| CondaListJsonParser | `from cyclonedx.parser.conda import CondaListJsonParser` | Parses input provided as a `str` that is output from `conda list --json` |
| CondaListExplicitParser | `from cyclonedx.parser.conda import CondaListExplicitParser` | Parses input provided as a `str` that is output from `conda list --explicit` or `conda list --explicit --md5` |
| Environment | `from cyclonedx.parser.environment import EnvironmentParser` | Looks at the packaged installed in your current Python environment. |
| PipEnvParser | `from cyclonedx.parser.pipenv import PipEnvParser` | Parses `Pipfile.lock` content passed in as a string. |
| PipEnvFileParser | `from cyclonedx.parser.pipenv import PipEnvFileParser` | Parses the `Pipfile.lock` file at the supplied path. |
| PoetryParser | `from cyclonedx.parser.poetry import PoetryParser` | Parses `poetry.lock` content passed in as a string. |
| PoetryFileParser | `from cyclonedx.parser.poetry import PoetryFileParser` | Parses the `poetry.lock` file at the supplied path. |
| RequirementsParser | `from cyclonedx.parser.requirements import RequirementsParser` | Parses a multiline string that you provide that conforms to the `requirements.txt` [PEP-508](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0508/) standard. |
| RequirementsFileParser | `from cyclonedx.parser.requirements import RequirementsFileParser` | Parses a file that you provide the path to that conforms to the `requirements.txt` [PEP-508](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0508/) standard. |

#### Example

```
from cyclonedx.parser.environment import EnvironmentParser

parser = EnvironmentParser()
```

#### Notes on Requirements parsing

CycloneDX software bill-of-materials require pinned versions of requirements. If your `requirements.txt` does not have 
pinned versions, warnings will be recorded and the dependencies without pinned versions will be excluded from the 
generated CycloneDX. CycloneDX schemas (from version 1.0+) require a component to have a version when included in a
CycloneDX bill of materials (according to schema).

If you need to use a `requirements.txt` in your project that does not have pinned versions an acceptable workaround 
might be to:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip freeze > requirements-frozen.txt
```

You can then feed in the frozen requirements from `requirements-frozen.txt` _or_ use the `Environment` parser one you
have `pip install`ed your dependencies.

### Modelling

You can create a BOM Model from either a Parser instance or manually using the methods avaialbel directly on the `Bom` class.

The model also supports definition of vulnerabilities for output using the CycloneDX schema extension for 
[Vulnerability Disclosures](https://cyclonedx.org/use-cases/#vulnerability-disclosure) as of version 0.3.0.

**Note:** Known vulnerabilities associated with Components can be sourced from various data sources, but this library 
will not source them for you. Perhaps look at [Jake](https://github.com/sonatype-nexus-community/jake) if you're interested in this.

#### Example from a Parser

```
from cyclonedx.model.bom import Bom
from cyclonedx.parser.environment import EnvironmentParser

parser = EnvironmentParser()
bom = Bom.from_parser(parser=parser)
```

### Generating Output

Once you have an instance of a `Bom` you can produce output in either `JSON` or `XML` against any of the supporting CycloneDX schema versions as you require.

We provide two helper methods:
1. Output to string (for you to do with as you require)
2. Output directly to a filename you provide

##### Example as JSON

```
from cyclonedx.output import get_instance, OutputFormat

outputter = get_instance(bom=bom, output_format=OutputFormat.JSON)
outputter.output_as_string()
```

##### Example as XML
```
from cyclonedx.output import get_instance, SchemaVersion

outputter = get_instance(bom=bom, schema_version=SchemaVersion.V1_2)
outputter.output_to_file(filename='/tmp/sbom-v1.2.xml')
```

## Library API Documentation

The Library API Documentation is available online at [https://cyclonedx.github.io/cyclonedx-python-lib/](https://cyclonedx.github.io/cyclonedx-python-lib/).

## Schema Support

This library is a work in progress and complete support for all parts of the CycloneDX schema will come in future releases.

Here is a summary of the parts of the schema supported by this library:

_Note: We refer throughout using XPath, but the same is true for both XML and JSON output formats._

   <thead>
      <tr>
         <th>XPath</th>

         <th>Support v1.2</th>

         <td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td>
         <td>

            automatically populated when using a <code>Parser</code>.
         </td>
      </tr>
   </tbody>
</table>

### Notes on Schema Support

1. N/A is where the CycloneDX standard does not include this
2. If the table above does not refer to an element, it is not currently supported

## Python Support

We endeavour to support all functionality for all [current actively supported Python versions](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
However, some features may not be possible/present in older Python versions due to their lack of support.
