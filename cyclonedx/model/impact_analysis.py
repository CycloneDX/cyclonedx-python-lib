    The vulnerability status of a given version or range of versions of a product.

    The status 'unknown' indicates that it is unknown or unspecified whether the given version is affected. There can
    be many reasons for an 'unknown' status, including that an investigation has not been undertaken or that a vendor
    has not disclosed the status.
