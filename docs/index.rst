CycloneDXâ€™s Python Library documentation
====================================================

OWASP `CycloneDX`_ is a full-stack Bill of Materials (BOM) standard
that provides advanced supply chain capabilities for cyber risk reduction.

This Python package provides data models, validators and more,
to help you create/render/read CycloneDX documents.

**This package is not designed for standalone use. It is a software library.**

As of version ``3.0.0`` of this library, the internal data model was adjusted to allow CycloneDX VEX documents to be produced as per
`official examples`_ linking VEX to a separate CycloneDX document.

If you're looking for a CycloneDX tool to run to generate (SBOM) software bill-of-materials documents, why not checkout
`CycloneDX Python`_ or `Jake`_.
