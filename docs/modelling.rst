Modelling
=========

You can create a BOM Model from either a :py:mod:`cyclonedx.parser` instance or manually using the methods available
directly on the :py:mod:`cyclonedx.model.bom.Bom` class.

Vulnerabilities are supported by the Model as of version 0.3.0.

    **Note:** Known vulnerabilities associated with Components can be sourced from various data sources, but this library
    will not source them for you. Perhaps look at `Jake`_ if you're interested in this.

Example BOM created programmatically
------------------------------------

.. note::

    It is recommended that you have a good understanding of the `CycloneDX Schema`_ before attempting to create a BOM
    programmatically with this library.


For the most up-to-date in-depth examples, look at our `Unit Tests`_.

Example BOM created from existing CycloneDX BOM
------------------------------------

.. note::

    Supported from version 4.0.0 of this library.

Deserializing from a CycloneDX JSON BOM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each model class in this library that is serializable provides a magic ``from_json()`` method.

See the example below to read and deserialize a JSON CycloneDX document. Note that reading the file and loading as JSON
is the programmers responsibility.

.. code-block:: python

    import json
    from cyclonedx.model.bom import Bom

    with open('/path/to/my/cyclonedx.json') as input_json:
        deserialized_bom = Bom.from_json(data=json.loads(input_json.read()))


Deserializing from a CycloneDX XML BOM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each model class in this library that is serializable provides a magic ``from_xml()`` method.

See the example below to read and deserialize a XML CycloneDX document. Note that reading the file and loading as XML
is the programmers responsibility. Be careful to avoid XML vulnerabilities as documented `here`_. It is recommended that
you use a library such as `defusedxml` instead of the native `xml.etree.ElementTree`.

.. code-block:: python

    from xml.etree import ElementTree
    from cyclonedx.model.bom import Bom

    with open('/path/to/my/cyclonedx.xml') as input_xml:
        deserialized_bom = cast(Bom, Bom.from_xml(data=ElementTree.fromstring(input_xml.read())))


Example BOM using a Parser
--------------------------

    **Note:** Concreate parser implementations were moved out of this library and into `CycloneDX Python`_ as of version
    ``1.0.0``.

.. code-block:: python

    from cyclonedx.model.bom import Bom
    from cyclonedx_py.parser.environment import EnvironmentParser

    parser = EnvironmentParser()
    bom = Bom.from_parser(parser=parser)
